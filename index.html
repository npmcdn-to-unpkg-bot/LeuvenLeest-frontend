    		<h2>What is LeuvenLeest?</h2>
    		<p>
    			LeuvenLeest is an app focused on finding and sharing cool reading places with 3 distincts dimensions to it:
    		</p>
    		<div class="dimensions">
    			<div class="dim">
    				<h3>Where?</h3>
    				<p>
    					First of all, it helps you discover cool reading spots and filter them to your likings. Maybe you'd like a quiet outside place, or somewhere with chill music and good coffee? LeuvenLeest will help you find your perfect spot<br>
    					If you find a place you like, you can check-in that location, or add it to your favourite spots, and it will be easier for you to find it again later.<br>
    					And if you find a place that's not listed in LeuvenLeest, you can even add it to the app!
    				</p>
    			</div>
    			<div class="dim">
    				<h3>Who?</h3>
    				<p>
    					You also have the possibillity to add people to your friends, so you can easily join them for nice reading sessions together.<br>
    					Maybe you have a friend who always finds the best spots around Leuven and you'd be interested in finding some of those ?
    				</p>
    			</div>
    			<div class="dim">
    				<h3>What?</h3>
    				<p>
    					You can also let people know what kind of books you are reading.<br>
    					Who knows, you might find out that there's a lot of people interested in the same books as you in your neighborhood and you'll be able to set up a local book club ?<br>
    					Letting you search by specific book genre will help you surround yourself with people that share your interests.
    				</p>
    			</div>
    		</div>
    		<p>
    			LeuvenLeest is a great tool to bring together people that share a love for reading!
